# 🧱 f — Minimal 2D Physics Game

A simple yet fun block-stacking game using **Pygame** and **Pymunk**.
Inspired by physics and built for future reinforcement learning experiments.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install pygame pymunk
python main.py
```

## 🎮 Gameplay (Initial Version)

* Blocks fall automatically from the top.
* Move left/right using the arrow keys (`←` / `→`).
* Try to stack them neatly to build the highest tower possible!
* Game ends when a block falls off or the stack reaches the top.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* Pygame (for graphics and input)
* Pymunk (for 2D physics)

## 🧠 Future Ideas

* Score system based on precision
* Game-over detection (falling blocks or tilt)
* Sound effects and visual feedback
* Reinforcement learning API wrapper

> Just one file. Just one rule: Stack smart, stack high.
